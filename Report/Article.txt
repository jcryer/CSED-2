Self-monitoring and Technology: Challenges and Open Issues in Personal Informatics (pg 613)

The article defines personal informatics as "a school of thought which aims to use technology for aquiring data on different aspects of the daily lives of people". It lists many advantages of personal informatics over other forms of self tracking, such as ease of use, automation and visualization. However it also states that "common users" who do not have prior experience with self-monitoring activities can find it difficult to use personal informatics systems due to lack of familiarity and motivation. As well as this, many commercial products such as Nike+, MoodPanda and Jawbone lack an understanding of common user's needs and instead design their product around people who are experienced with personal informatics systems. 

The article suggest possible ways of solving this problem based on a study by Korotitsch and Nelson Gray which identifies factors which affect the accuraccy and reactivity of self monitoring systems. The study identifies 8 factors which affect the accuracy of data collected: "awareness of accuracy checks; topography of the target behavior; training in self-tracking; compliance; accuracy-contingent reinforcement; nature of the recording device; concurrent response requirements; valence of the target behavior". The study also identifies 8 factors which affect the reactivity of self monitoring: "target behavior valence; motivation for change; topography of the target behavior; schedule or recording; concurrent response requirements; timing of recording; goal-setting feedback and reinforcement; nature of the selfrecording device".
 
Not all of these factors can be controlled by a personal informatics system, but some of them can be carefully considered to increase the effectiveness of the user's self monitoring.
